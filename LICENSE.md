# PRE-MIT License

Toay's **PRE-MIT license** is an open source license that simulates but **has prerequisites** in front of the MIT license.

The license is still being composed to fully meet the open source requirements and it's contents may be changed from time to time.
So please take a step to the online version to check the requirements if you think they are what you might need.

You can also help improve the license project by contributing to the repository here on github:
